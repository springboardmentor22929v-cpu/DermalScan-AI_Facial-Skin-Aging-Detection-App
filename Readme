# DermalScan: AI_Facial Skin Aging Detection App

## Project Statement
The objective is to develop a deep learning-based system that can detect and classify facial aging signs—such as wrinkles, dark spots, puffy eyes, and clear skin—using a pretrained EfficientNetB0 model. The pipeline includes face detection using Haar Cascades, custom preprocessing and data augmentation, and classification with percentage predictions. A web-based frontend will enable users to upload images and visualize aging signs with annotated bounding boxes and labels.

## Outcomes
- Detect and localize facial features indicating aging.  
- Classify detected features into categories like wrinkles, dark spots, puffy eyes, and clear skin using a trained CNN model.  
- Train and evaluate an EfficientNetB0 model for robust classification.  
- Build a web-based frontend for uploading facial images and viewing annotated outputs.  
- Integrate a backend pipeline that processes input images and returns annotated results.  
- Export annotated outputs and logs for documentation or analysis.
